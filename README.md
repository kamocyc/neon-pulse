# NEON_PULSE - Cyberpunk Social Dashboard

A futuristic cyberpunk-themed social network interface built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Neural Broadcasting**: Share your digital transmissions with the network
- **Interactive Grid**: View, engage, and amplify signals from other users
- **Biometric Access**: Secure login/identity verification system with local data persistence
- **Responsive Interface**: Adapts to any neural connection device (desktop/mobile)
- **Neon Animations**: Dynamic visual feedback with cyberpunk aesthetics

## System Access

1. Launch `index.html` in your neural interface browser
2. Create an identity or use the demo credentials:
   - ID Code: `demo`
   - Neural Key: `password`
3. Begin broadcasting to the network!

## Interface Commands

- **Transmit Signal**: Enter your message in the broadcast field and click "Transmit"
- **Signal Boost**: Click the retweet icon to amplify other transmissions
- **Neural Link**: Click the heart icon to establish a neural link with content
- **Identity Control**: Access your profile settings through the ID portal

## Technical Specifications

This interface is constructed with pure digital architecture:
- HTML5 core structure
- CSS3 visual rendering (with neural-responsive animations)
- JavaScript neural command processing
- Local data persistence for offline functionality

No external neural frameworks or dependencies required to establish connection.

## Demo Identity

A default identity is automatically provisioned on first boot:
- ID Code: `demo`
- Neural Key: `password`

## Compatibility Matrix

This neural interface performs optimally in modern connection browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
